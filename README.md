# BikeSharing

To view the full story of the analytical proposal: [Challenge Proposal](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sierra.knighten/viz/BikeSharing_Challenge/BikeSharingResults)


## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  To solidofy the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.  This analysis shows the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 

## Results

Let's begin with gender breakdown. A pie chart was created to display the gender breakdown of all the bike users.  Hovering over each section, we see males were the biggest users of the bike service in New York city.

The line graph represents the duration of usage from all users.  Most users rode the bikes for about 5 minutes.

This line graph breaks down the duration time down by gender. As an extension to the pie chart, more males rode the bikes than females. Again, the highest duration is 5 to 6 minutes. A little over 100K males riding for 5 minutes, and a little over 30K females riding the bikes for 6 minutes.

This heat map represents what times and days of the week bikes were rode for all users. The highest densities are seen at the hours of 8am and 5 to 6 pm. This is expected due to workday hours. Most people are on their way to work early in the morning and getting off work in the evening. The weekend hours are a bit expected with maximum densities ranging from 10am to 6pm. People are working, exercising, and just enjoying recreational activities in the city.

This heat map is an extension to the previous map, it further breaks it down according to gender. If we use the filter check boxes, the density of male and female users is the same during the week. Both have a higher density at 8am and 5 to 6 pm. Which again coincides with work hours. But, if we look at Saturday, the higher usage is done by males.

Here we have another heat map, it not only breaks it down into gender, but also into unsubscribe and subscribed customers. As seems in the other maps, males are the dominant users. This heat map also eliminates the unknown genders in the subscriber section.

This last chart shows an age breakdown of users. Those born in the year 1969 seem to be the biggest customers. Since, this chart is not broken down into subscribers and customers, we do have worry if this data is accurate. The year 1969 could be a joke, hence the sexual nature of the number 69.  If data is accurate it would mean most of the users are 50 years of age.  Once would expect a younger demographic using the bike service.


## Summary 

The main purpose of this proposal was to evaluate wether or not a bike service would be benefical for Des Moines. The data we use for New York City. New York is a very big and busy city, while Des Monies is the opposite in comparison. Although we may get the same trends for a bike service is Des Monies, the profit would not be as big. We have to look at the bigger picture. New York is a larger city, but businesses are plentiful and located near each other. Des Monies is a smaller city. We can assume there are the same types of busniesses, but they are more spread out compared to New York. Riding a bike 3 miles in Des Monies is not the same as riding a bike 3 miles is Des Monies.  There runs the chance of no bikes in the area in Des Monies when needed versus New York city where they would be plentiful. Most people already have cars to get them from place to place with no problem versus New York City where walking or bike riding is a normal daily practice. The bikes would be used for tourist attractions. The same could be said for Des Monies, but these areas are in business districts. This is not the same for Des Monies. A great deal of advertising, and more research would need to be done to make a better decision.
