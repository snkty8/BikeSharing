# BikeSharing

## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  To solidofy the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.  This analysis shows the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. 

## Results

Let's begin with gender breakdown.  A pie chart was created to to display the gender breakdown of all the bike users.  Here we see males were the biggest users of the bike service in New York city.

The line graphs represents the duration of usage from all users.  Most users rode the bikes for 5 minutes.

This line graph breaks down the duration time down by gender.  As an exenstion to the the pie chart, more males rode the bikes than females.  Again, the highest duration is 5 to 6 minutes. A little over 100K males riding for 5 minutes to a little over 30K females riding the bikes for 6 minutes.

This heat map represents what times and days of the week bikes were rode for all users.  The highest densities are seen at the hours of 8am and 5 to 6 pm.  This is expected due to work day hours.  Most people are on they're way to work early in the morning, and getting off work in the evening. The weekend hours are a bit expected with maximum densities ranging from 10am to 6pm.  People are working, exercising, and just enjoying the date in New York City.

The heat map is an extension to the previous map, it further breaks it down according to gender.  If we use the filter check boxes, the density of male and female users are the same during the week.  Both have a higher density at 8am and 5 to 6 pm.  Which again coinsides with work hours.  But, if we look at Saturday, the higher usage is done by males.

Here we have another heat map, it not only breaks it down into gender, but also into unsubscribe and subcribed customers. As seems in the other maps, males are the dominant users. This heat map also eliminates the unknown section in the subscriber section.

This last chart shows an age breakdown of users.   Those born in the year 1969 seem to be the biggest customers.  Since, this chart is not broken down into subscribers and customers, we do have worry if this data is acurate.  The year 1969 could be a joke, hence the sexual nature of the number 69.
