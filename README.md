## Overview 
The purpose of this project is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.  To solidofy the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.  This analysis shows the length of time the bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
